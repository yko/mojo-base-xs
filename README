    Mojo::Base::XS - very fast Mojo-styled accessors

INSTALLATION

SYNOPSIS

        # Replace Mojo::Base

        use Mojo::Base;

        has foo => 'bar';
        has [qw/x y z/] => 42;
        has foo_defaults => sub { Bar->new };

        # Or use as standalone accessor generator
        package Bar;
        use Mojo::Base::XS;

        has bar => 'bar';
        has [qw/x y z/] => 42;
