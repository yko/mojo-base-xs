   * bit of data here, say a void* for user data, whatever). But when you
   * think about it some more, you'll see that this has various nasty
   * consequences in the context of re-using the hashkey entries.
   * - Hashkey structs are shared and there's a reverse look-up using the
   *   hash-key-string itself for that purpose.
   * - Sharing the hashkey structs is important for threads: Otherwise, we
   *   have to implement full cloning on thread creation. Oh my.
   * - If we didn't share hashkey structs, we'd have to deallocate them when
   *   an accessor method is no longer used. That means detecting when that
   *   happens. Note that there is not reference counting mechanism we can
   *   use to make this easy. So the sharing/reuse of hashkey structs was a
   *   way to avoid this real or perceived memory leak on re-generation of
   *   accessors for the same object slot.
